/**
 * Prototype Design pattern
 *
 * <p>A fully initialized objects that need to be copied or cloned without reference. For ex: You
 * are playing a game of chess, where every game has same initial setup. Before the starting of
 * every game we need to have an initial setup. But creating an object with initial setup is
 * tedious. So inorder to avoid that we follow prototype pattern, where an object is ready available
 * with initial setup throughout the lifecycle and where ever it is needed just clone it.
