/**
 * Proxy Design Pattern
 *
 * <p>Proxy means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal
 * meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern. Proxies are also called
 * surrogates, handles, and wrappers. They are closely related in structure, but not purpose, to
 * Adapters and Decorators.
 *
 * <p>A real world example can be a cheque or credit card is a proxy for what is in our bank
 * account. It can be used in place of cash, and provides a means of accessing that cash when
 * required. And that’s exactly what the Proxy pattern does – “Controls and manage access to the
 * object they are protecting“.
 *
 * <p>Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper to cover the main object’s complexity
 * from the client.
