/**
 * Flyweight Design pattern
 *
 * <p>Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease
 * memory footprint and increase performance. This type of design pattern comes under structural
 * pattern as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving the object
 * structure of application.
 *
 * <p>Flyweight pattern tries to reuse already existing similar kind objects by storing them and
 * creates new object when no matching object is found.
